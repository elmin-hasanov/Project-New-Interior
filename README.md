# 🌐 My Web Project  

## 🚀 Project Description  
This project is a simple yet modern website that I created as part of my course. I used **HTML and CSS** to design a responsive and interactive layout.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
### **1️⃣ HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  
- Structuring the website with semantic HTML tags (`header`, `nav`, `section`, `footer`).  
- Embedding images, links, and forms.  
- Using `div` containers to group elements.  

### **2️⃣ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**  
- **Flexbox & Grid** for a modern layout and better element arrangement.  
- **Media Queries** for responsive design across different devices.  
- **Custom Fonts** with `@font-face` to load unique typefaces.  
- **Parallax Effects** using `background-attachment: fixed;` for cool background effects.  
- **Animations & Transitions** with `hover` effects and `transform`.  
- **Form Styling** to enhance the appearance of input fields.  

## 📱 Responsiveness  
The website is optimized for different screen sizes:  
✅ **Desktop** (1024px and above)  
✅ **Tablet** (768px - 1024px)  
✅ **Smartphones** (up to 430px)
